# PaymentProcessingDummyScript
A dummy script for payment processing and testing the quality of my code

"""

Using OOP, design a dummy payment processing system that consists of the following components:
- Payment processor
- Transaction
- User

Payment processor types:
- Processing credit card payments
- Processing PayPal payments
- Processing bank account payments

Each payment processor should be able to:
- process one-time payments
- process subscription-based payments
- process refunds
- issue invoices

Transaction should have the following attributes:
- id
- confirmation code
- user
- amount
- status (pending, paid, cancelled)

User:
- id
- username
- first_name
- last_name
- full_name
- pending_transactions
- paid_transactions
- total_paid_amount


IMPORTANT NOTES
- Do not implement the actual functionality of the mentioned payment processors. Use print statements to denote actions.
- When implementing attributes, please note that persistent and computed property determination is up to you.
- Feel free to flex your Python muscles in any way you can to display your level of experience.
